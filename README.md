# Unit 3 Programming Project #
## Goal: ##
_Create a Java program using Unit 3 topics to demonstrate knowledge and mastery._
## Requirements: ##
1. All Unit Deliverables must be tied to a real-world topic:
    - Should be linked to an article, podcast, video, etc.
**OR** 
    - A personal idea for something that is useful/fun for you, your community, etc.
2. Your project must use materials from, and restricted to, topics we've covered so far. Specifically: 
- Must include at least 1 programmer-defined class for each group member, in addition to the `Main` class.
  - [ ] each class definition must have **at least** 3 instance variables representing two or more datatypes (`String`, `int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
  - [ ] each class definition must have **all** of our required methods for encapsulation:
  	- [ ] no-argument (a.k.a. default) constructor method
  	- [ ] full constructor method
  	- [ ] accesssor/getter and mutator/setter methods for each instance variable
  	- [ ] `setAll` method
  	- [ ] `toString` method
  	- [ ] `equals` method
  - [ ] you *may* add any additional methods, static or non-static, that are useful to your project, the above is just the mininum
-  Must have a tester class (`Main`) that tests the use of each method in the programmer-defined class type.
  - [ ] instantiate an object using the no-argument constructor
  - [ ] instantiate an object using the full constructor method
  - [ ] use each accesssor and mutator method
  - [ ] use the `setAll` method
  - [ ] use the `toString` method
  - [ ] use the `equals` method multiple times to make sure it returns true and false as apporpriate

## Resources: ##
- OLI Modules + Lecture Videos for examples, Java syntax rules, and strategy
- Labs for larger examples, getting inspiration or ideas
- You are allowed to expand on your Unit 1 or Unit 2 Programming Project as well!

## Scoring Guide: ##
All group members might not recieve the same score. Be sure to indicate which parts of the project you contributed. You may also be asked to explain portions of the code so that I can distinguish your personal understanding of the material.

- **Not Assessable (N)**: Not enough information is present in the work to determine whether there is understanding of the concepts.
- **Revision Needed (R)**: Partial understanding of the concepts is evident, but there are significant gaps. Further review and improvements required. Program does not run or not all requirements are met. 
- **Acceptable (A)**: Understanding of the concepts is evident. Code compiles and runs without errors. All of the requirements are met.
- **Exemplary (E)**: Everything for A plus code is well-documented and follows all course style conventions. This work could be used as a classroom example.
